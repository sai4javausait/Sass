# Sass Course
This is the repository for my course, Sass .

## Instructions
I have written all the mixins and variables required for given website using Sass and I have also used Grunt as a Task runner for this project.

## How to run 

1) Install grunt use "npm install -g grunt-cli"
2) Install grunt in your project folder "npm install grunt --save-dev"
3) Now do "npm init" to create package.json
4) Now as you installed all the packages required run the project using "grunt" command.

Thank you very much. Don't forget to check the gruntfile. Enjoy!
